  		<p>The image above is a visual representation of how the Spreadsheet Form will look.
  				Notice that the text labels in the Menu bar have underlined letters. These provide
  				an additional mechanism for navigating through the Menu bar. Simply press the Alt key
  				followed by the underlined letter in the Menu bar. For example, to Save the Current
  				Spreadsheet, press [Alt + F, S] and a prompt will appear in which a file name and 
  				location can be chosen.
  				</br>
  			The name of the current Spreadsheet is always visible. Notice the the title of the Form window 
  				says "Spreadsheet - untitled". In this case, untitled is the name of the Spreadsheet.
  				Untitled is the default name for a new spreadsheet; it signifies that the current Spreadsheet
  				has not been saved. When the Spreadsheet is saved, its file name will be displayed in the
  				Form's title. The full path of the current Spreadsheet is also presented in the Status Strip
  				at the bottom of the Form window. In the image below, the Form will display the full path of the 
  				Spreadsheet with the file name "Help_Demonstration.ss" in the Status strip.

  		<a id="Safety"><p></br><b>Safety Features</b></p></a>
  		<p>Before closing the Spreadsheet Form, this application performs a data integrity safety check. 
  				If closing the Form will result in the loss of any data, the user will be prompted to Save,
  				or continue to close without saving, or cancel the closing process of the application. 
  				The image below illustrates the dialog that will be prompted to the user while closing an 
  				unsaved Spreadsheet Form.
  				</br>
          If the client is connected to the server, the closing the Spreadsheet Form will automatically
          send the server a DISCONNECT message.

  		<a id="Features"><p></br><b>Additional Features</b></p></a>
  		<p> There are two functions in the Option menu: Display Dependents and Show All Negatives. These functions
  				operate as their names suggest. Display Dependents finds all the cells in the Spreadsheet whose value
  				are dependent, directly or indirectly, on the currently selected cell. Each cell is then displayed
  				in a Message Box. Show all Negatives finds all the cells in the Spreadsheet whose values are 
  				negative numbers. Each cell is then displayed in the a Message Box. The result of these two functions
  				are represented in the two images below, respectively.
